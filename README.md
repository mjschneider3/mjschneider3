👋 Hi there!

I'm a recent graduate from the University of San Francisco where I earned my B.A. in psychology. I now work as a Research Specialist for the Princeton Social Neuroscience Lab where I study the effects of imagination and mental simulation on the self. I am interested in social cognition, interpersonal relationships, and prejudice. 

I first became interested in psychological research in my freshman year at the University of San Francisco. I became a member of Dr. Marisa Knight's Emotion and Cognition Lab where I was able to learn the fundamentals of research and apply my skills to an independent thesis project. Over the next three years I was a research assistant with Dr. Lisa Wagner in the Aging and Diversity Lab, and Dr. Indre Viskontas in the Creative Brain Lab. I also acted as a Lab Manager for Dr. Edward Munnich in the Metacognition and Learning Lab. I believe in open science practices and research that benefits the community.
